# UFOs (Gradable assignment code documents are in the Challenge subfolder)

##Overview

A website was created to display and filter UFO sightings based on characteristics of the data. The website was created through a combination of HTML and JavaScript files.
The website displays the date, city, state, country, and duration of the sighting. It also includes the shape of the object sighted and any details of the sighting. The 
website improves on a previous version. Int he previous version the website was searchable by date. In the newest version the website also is searchable by city, state,
and country of sighting. It also can be searched by the shape of the object.

###Results

To use the website one would enter the criteria that that are of interest to them in one or more search fields on the right as shown below, in which the initials for California(ca)
have been entered into the state field:

The resulting events would be displayed on the right as shown below:

###Summary

1. Drawbacks: A current drawback of the website is that, despite the greater number of filtering options, it is still limited and awkward to use. Both duration and comments
are not searchable. It also doesn't provide context for the data. Lists based on characteristics are more useful than unfiltered data but not a major improvement.

2. Improvements: The current design of the website allows filtering but does not allow for prioritized filtering. It could be improved to focus on one particular 
characteristic (e.g. shape), listing those with the most desirable characteristic first, followed by those without the most desirable characteristic but still meet the 
criteria for inclusion. Another improvement is that the location data could be used to generate maps of sightings.
